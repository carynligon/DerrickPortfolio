    name: 'Nike Innovation Report',
    firstDescription: 'This Nike innovation report focuses on their major innovations in 2013, predominately through their improved shoe technologies. It was designed around three words: recycle, repurpose, reinvent. Nike\'s approach isn\'t to build from scratch, but to reuse and build upon what they have done in the past, to improve now, and continue to improve in the future.',
    secondDescription: 'The report attempts to portray that idea. The light, open spreads, the simple typography, and the limited yet strong color palette all compliment Nike\'s strong, lightweight shoes and their simple approach to innovation. Note: Unfortunately, this was done as a project in the University of Florida\'s graphic design program and not for Nike.',
